<B><i>Introduction:</i></b>

    This is the app/bot that does attendance for you in fuse-classroom so that you don't become disqualified for exams for being absent in class.

<B><i>How does it Work?</i></b>

    well, it logs in with your login information periodically ( in every 30 minutes ), click join_class if any live classes are being conducted and close the page which triggers fuse-classroom to record your attendance.<br><br><br>
